# Intelligent-Chatbot
to run the file locally: `python3 chatgui.py` 

`chatgui.py` contains the GUI of the chatbot using which the user can interact with the bot. 

The primary focus of the bot is to guide people in the ongoing pandemic, answer questions regarding vaccinations, symptoms, live covid statistics, probability of being infected to name a few. 

### Training of the Chatbot
- run `python3 train_chatbot.py` in the terminal to train the chatbot. 
    - `words.pkl`, `classes.pkl` and `Chatbot_model.h5` will be generated.
    - `words.pkl` stores the the words Python object that contains a list of our vocabulary, `classes.pkl` contains the categories and `Chatbot_model.h5` contains the trained model that contains information about the model and has weights of the neurons.
- We have trained our chatbot using the `keras` module and`nltk` wordnets to the intents.json present in the Data folder.  
- A special recurrent neural network (LSTM) is used to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.

## Functionalities
### Probability of being infected
An existing dataset was used to collect data regarding 7 features and the state of the patient(i.e. if she/he has COVID or not). Using the data, a Naive Bayes Classifier from the `sklearn` module was trained in order to predict new cases of COVID. The user is asked to input the details in a specific format after which the classifier predicts probability of the user having COVID.

### Live covid statistics
